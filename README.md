# MDP Value Iteration with GUI

This project implements the Markov Decision Process (MDP) Value Iteration algorithm with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to visualize the changes in grid values with each iteration. The GUI is made using CustomTkinter

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tanvir-a0/MDP-Value-Iteration-.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd MDP-Value-Iteration-`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python main.py`
5. Use the GUI to interact with the MDP Value Iteration algorithm:
   - Set the parameters such as grid size, reward values, discount factor, etc.
   - Initiate the algorithm and observe the changes in grid values with each iteration.
